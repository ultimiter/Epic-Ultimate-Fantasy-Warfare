Skin Modification: Add freckles on face. I don't think that needs to be adjusted on the UV maps when the skin/material is modified, but make sure to do rendering checks afterward to see if it looks good.
Hair: Ronin-ish style, "blown out," or short?
Skin Modification: Right arm, lower segment features a tatoo. Going to need to determine location for mapping onto the skin, and then draw it over it with manipulation of layers and alpha channels.
Eye Texture Modification: Mix Bluegreen with either Blue or Green to get desired effect. Which one... that will need to be tested.
